## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
Wealthsimple is breaking down traditional barriers that were formed by the banks to make investing more accessible. 

When people start investing the first hurdle they have to overcome is the sign-up process. 7 years ago Canadians had to go to the bank to open a brokerage account. The ease of use of the signup process for Wealthsimple has made it easy for new investors to open up their brokerage account and can be done within minutes on Wealthsimple.
				
The knowledge available on how to trade is overwhelming for people that are just starting out investing. There is asymmetric information between the bank and the customer. It is not common practice in the industry to communicate in clear and simple terms to the customer. The complicated language that is used makes it difficult for new investors that do not have a background or interest in personal finance to take their first step in investing. The layout of Wealthsimple's website is simple and clear. They do this by clean design with infographics and simple explanations of their services.

The account minimum with Wealthsimple is $1, this is accessible to everyday people. The traditional institutions would have minimums of $50,000 to be able to take your money to invest. Big financial institutions do this so they are guaranteed a worthwhile return on the money they invest. By Wealthsimple accepting smaller accounts, their customers are able to build good financial habits at a younger age so young people can build their wealth and take advantage of compound interest.

When investing small amounts of money, fees can have a negative effect on the returns of your investment that you make. Traditional banks in the past have hidden the cost of fees from their customers. Wealthsimple is transparent with their fees so customers feel they understand the true cost of their investment.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
